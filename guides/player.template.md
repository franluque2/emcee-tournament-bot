**Report scores**
You report your own scores to Emcee in direct messages or a channel with Emcee.
Both you and opponent need to report.
If you won 2-0, copy and paste this command:
```
munin!score {}|2-0```
If you won 2-1, copy and paste this command:
```
munin!score {}|2-1```
If you lost 0-2, copy and paste this command:
```
munin!score {}|0-2```
If you lost 1-2, copy and paste this command:
```
munin!score {}|1-2```
In Swiss, ties are also a valid outcome:
```
munin!score {}|1-1
munin!score {}|0-0```
**Drop**
If you want to stop playing. If you're in the middle of a round, this will concede the current match.
Be careful, this **removes you from the tournament permanently**.
```
munin!drop {}```
